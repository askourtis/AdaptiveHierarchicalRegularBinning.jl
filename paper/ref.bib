  abstract = {This paper develops the multidimensional binary search tree (or               k               -d tree, where               k               is the dimensionality of the search space) as a data structure for storage of information to be retrieved by associative searches. The               k               -d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an               n               record file are: insertion,               O               (log               n               ); deletion of the root,               O               (               n                                (                 k                 -1)/                 k                              ); deletion of a random node,               O               (log               n               ); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches),               O               (               n               log               n               ). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with               t               keys specified [proven maximum running time of               O               (               n                                (                 k                 -                 t                 )/                 k                              )] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of               O               (log               n               ).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that               k               -d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.},

  abstract = {In-place radix sort is a popular distribution-based sorting algorithm for short numeric or string keys due to its linear run-time and constant memory complexity. However, efficient parallelization of in-place radix sort is very challenging for two reasons. First, the initial phase of permuting elements into buckets suffers read-write dependency inherent in its in-place nature. Secondly, load balancing of the recursive application of the algorithm to the resulting buckets is difficult when the buckets are of very different sizes, which happens for skewed distributions of the input data. In this paper, we present a novel parallel in-place radix sort algorithm, PARADIS, which addresses both problems: a) ``speculative permutation'' solves the first problem by assigning multiple non-continuous array stripes to each processor. The resulting shared-nothing scheme achieves full parallelization. Since our speculative permutation is not complete, it is followed by a ``repair'' phase, which can again be done in parallel without any data sharing among the processors. b) ``distribution-adaptive load balancing'' solves the second problem. We dynamically allocate processors in the context of radix sort, so as to minimize the overall completion time. Our experimental results show that PARADIS offers excellent performance/scalability on a wide range of input data sets.},

  abstract = {The problem of identifying the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNNS) of a point has proven to be very useful both as a standalone application and as a subroutine in larger applications. Given its far-reaching applicability in areas such as machine learning and point clouds, extensive research has gone into leveraging GPU acceleration to solve this problem. Recent work has shown that using Ray Tracing cores in recent GPUs to accelerate kNNS is much more efficient compared to traditional acceleration using shader cores. However, the existing translation of kNNS to a ray tracing problem imposes a constraint on the search space for neighbors. Due to this, we can only use RT cores to accelerate fixed-radius kNNS, which requires the user to set a search radius a priori and hence can miss neighbors. In this work, we propose TrueKNN, the first unbounded RT-accelerated neighbor search. TrueKNN adopts an iterative approach where we incrementally grow the search space until all points have found their k neighbors. We show that our approach is orders of magnitude faster than existing approaches and can even be used to accelerate fixed-radius neighbor searches.},

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

Exploiting the intimate relationships between two primitive operations, select and sort, we introduce a cohort of truncated sort algorithms for parallel kNN search. The truncated bitonic sort (TBiS) in particular has desirable data locality, synchronous concurrency and simple data and program structures. Its implementation on a graphics processing unit outperforms the other existing implementations for kNN search based on either sort or select operations. We provide algorithm analysis and experimental results.},

  abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations.

Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

  abstract = {Molecular characterization of cell types using single-cell transcriptome sequencing is revolutionizing cell biology and enabling new insights into the physiology of human organs. We created a human reference atlas comprising nearly 500,000 cells from 24 different tissues and organs, many from the same donor. This atlas enabled molecular characterization of more than 400 cell types, their distribution across tissues, and tissue-specific variation in gene expression. Using multiple tissues from a single donor enabled identification of the clonal distribution of T cells between tissues, identification of the tissue-specific mutation rate in B cells, and analysis of the cell cycle state and proliferative potential of shared cell types across tissues. Cell type\textendash specific RNA splicing was discovered and analyzed across tissues within an individual.           ,              Mapping cell types in the human body             The Tabula Sapiens is a molecular reference atlas for more than 400 cell types of the human body. The Tabula Sapiens Consortium used single-cell transcriptomics to measure the messenger RNA molecules in each of nearly 500,000 cells from 24 tissues and organs (see the Perspective by Liu and Zhang). These data enable new insights into how the human genome parts list is used to create distinct cell types within the human organism. In addition to creating a detailed molecular definition of these cell types, the atlas reveals many other aspects of human biology, including how the same gene can be spliced differently in different cell types, how shared cell types in different tissues can have subtle differences in their identities, and how clones of the immune system can be shared across tissues. \textemdash LZ and DJ           ,              Single-cell transcriptomics provides a molecularly defined phenotypic reference of human cell types that spans 24 human tissues and organs.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Although the genome is often called the blueprint of an organism, it is perhaps more accurate to describe it as a parts list composed of the various genes that may or may not be used in the different cell types of a multicellular organism. Although nearly every cell in the body has essentially the same genome, each cell type makes different use of that genome and expresses a subset of all possible genes. This has motivated efforts to characterize the molecular composition of various cell types within humans and multiple model organisms, both by transcriptional and proteomic approaches. We created a human reference atlas comprising nearly 500,000 cells from 24 different tissues and organs, many from the same donor. This atlas enabled molecular characterization of more than 400 cell types, their distribution across tissues, and tissue-specific variation in gene expression.                                         RATIONALE               One caveat to current approaches to make cell atlases is that individual organs are often collected at different locations, collected from different donors, and processed using different protocols. Controlled comparisons of cell types between different tissues and organs are especially difficult when donors differ in genetic background, age, environmental exposure, and epigenetic effects. To address this, we developed an approach to analyzing large numbers of organs from the same individual.                                         RESULTS               We collected multiple tissues from individual human donors and performed coordinated single-cell transcriptome analyses on live cells. The donors come from a range of ethnicities, are balanced by gender, have a mean age of 51 years, and have a variety of medical backgrounds. Tissue experts used a defined cell ontology terminology to annotate cell types consistently across the different tissues, leading to a total of 475 distinct cell types with reference transcriptome profiles. The full dataset can be explored online with the cellxgene tool.               Data were collected for the bladder, blood, bone marrow, eye, fat, heart, kidney, large intestine, liver, lung, lymph node, mammary, muscle, pancreas, prostate, salivary gland, skin, small intestine, spleen, thymus, tongue, trachea, uterus, and vasculature. Fifty-nine separate specimens in total were collected, processed, and analyzed, and 483,152 cells passed quality control filtering. On a per-compartment basis, the dataset includes 264,824 immune cells, 104,148 epithelial cells, 31,691 endothelial cells, and 82,478 stromal cells. Working with live cells, as opposed to isolated nuclei, ensured that the dataset includes all mRNA transcripts within the cell, including transcripts that have been processed by the cell's splicing machinery, thereby enabling insight into variation in alternative splicing.                                The Tabula Sapiens also provided an opportunity to densely and directly sample the human microbiome throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The intestines from two donors were sectioned into five regions: the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and ascending and sigmoid colon. Each section was transected, and three to nine samples were collected from each location, followed by amplification and sequencing of the 16                 S                 ribosomal RNA gene.                                                        CONCLUSION               The Tabula Sapiens has revealed discoveries relating to shared behavior and subtle, organ-specific differences across cell types. We found T cell clones shared between organs and characterized organ-dependent hypermutation rates among B cells. Endothelial cells and macrophages are shared across tissues, often showing subtle but clear differences in gene expression. We found an unexpectedly large and diverse amount of cell type\textendash specific RNA splice variant usage and discovered and validated many previously undefined splices. The intestinal microbiome was revealed to have nonuniform species distributions down to the 3-inch (7.62-cm) length scale. These are but a few examples of how the Tabula Sapiens represents a broadly useful reference to deeply understand and explore human biology at cellular resolution.                                                   Overview of Tabula Sapiens.                   Molecular characterization of cell types using single-cell transcriptome sequencing is revolutionizing cell biology and enabling new insights into the physiology of human organs. We created a human reference atlas comprising nearly 500,000 cells from 24 different tissues and organs, many from the same donor. This multimodal atlas enabled molecular characterization of more than 400 cell types.},

Focus is placed on low accuracy optimizations, in response to the recent interest to use FMM as a preconditioner for sparse linear solvers. A direct comparison with other state-of-the-art fast N-body codes demonstrates that orders of magnitude increase in performance can be achieved by careful selection of the optimal algorithm and low-level optimization of the code. The current N-body solver uses a fast multipole method with an efficient strategy for finding the list of cell-cell interactions by a dual tree traversal. A task-based threading model is used to maximize thread-level parallelism and intra-node load-balancing. In order to extract the full potential of the SIMD units on the latest CPUs, the inner kernels are optimized using AVX instructions.},
